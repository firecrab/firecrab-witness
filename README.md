<h3>January 2018 Witness Update: </h3>

*Long time no updates?!*<br>
**Don't let the silence scare you.**<br>

**firecrab-witness** is working on contributing even more to the Peerplays community!<br/>
I have some good updates coming soon that will warrent a full witness update and article, but for the time being I will just give a brief and concise updates as to whats going on with firecrab-witness.

* I am currently running my witness node on a backup server.
* I am currently in the process of rebuilding my main server.
* I am currently in the process of setting up my testnet witness again.
* I am currently in the process of setting up 2 API/seed nodes (main/test net)

Once I have everything up and running within the next few days, I will create a full changelog article and make a table of my current setups and illustrate my contribution to the community. If you haven't yet, please vote for firecrab-witness!
